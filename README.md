Even nowadays I have the feeling there is many people who might want to give other non-Google/Facebook/Microsoft\[1\] services a try but simply don't know what else to use. You might be surprised but there is a good quantity of alternatives to pretty much all of Google/Facebook/Microsoft\[1\]'s services. Aside from the better privacy, not only are these alternatives good, they are often even better.

This list is about giving services a chance that are not part of one of the largest technology companies. But what's so bad about repeatedly supporting the same big tech companies? For one, it's for the purpose of supporting the competition. More competition means a wider variety of services to choose from. A wider spectrum of tools with perhaps one feature better than the other. A lack of competition means that only very few companies have a lot of power over a large amount of users. We need regulation. Don't you agree they are rich enough?

The hardest thing might be to get used to the new services and stopping habits of visiting the old ones. For years you have used that one service and now you need to get accustomed to a different one. It can be hard at first but just remember that it is possible.

All services listed have privacy unless explicitly mentioned that they don't. And even if they don't, even if they are exactly the same as Google/Facebook/Microsoft\[1\] in regard to privacy (although we do try to avoid that here), it is a step forward to an increase in competition.

This list starts with a popular service and then lists alternatives to it.

Ironically enough, this list is hosted on GitHub, a service owned by Microsoft. For most people it is nowadays hardly possible to escape *all* of the big tech company services. Most of us still carry a phone around that almost always runs either Android or iOS with the need of creating an account and agreeing to policies to get access to basic services we desire.  
But that doesn't mean we can't do anything at all. We can still de-Google/Facebook/Microsoft\[1\] our lives to some degree. The listed types of services are the most common and they are starting point of where we should begin to shift.

\[1\] Although this document only mentions the three classic examples Google, Facebook and Microsoft, that doesn't mean they are the only companies that face a threat to privacy. They are just examples.

\[2\] The discouraging ending "but don't particularly advertise privacy" isn't supposed to mean that this service is strictly to be avoided. As mentioned at the start of the document, it contributes to and serves the competition.
